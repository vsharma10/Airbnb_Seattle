Analysis from Airbnb, Seattle listing data for gaining some business related insights


# Airbnb Project

This project is one of the several other hands-on practice projects carried out as a part of the Data Science Nano Degree (DSND) program. In this project he Airbnb, Seattle data is explored to gain business related insights.

## 1. Installations

The required libraries for running the code within Jupiter notebook are part of the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6.2. Following libraries were used:

* pandas
* numpy
* collections
* datetime
* sklearn
* wordcloud
* matplotlib
* csv

## 2. Project Motivation

This project explored the utility of Airbnb, Seattle dataset for obtaining insights to remain competitive in the market. The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) pipeline was followed focussing on insights for "How to make your listing competitive?". The specific questions were:

* a) What are the key features that determine the listing price?
* b) What attributes can serve as determinants of customer influx?
* c) Can property description serve as an indicator of price or customer traffic (how to best describe your listing)?

## 3.File Descriptions

**airbnb_seattle.ipnyb**

This notebook presents the word related to addressing the above questions. The code for cleaning, engineering, and modeling data along with the markdown describing the process is presented.

**reqd_functions.py**

This file stores the functions that I used in the notebook.

**listings.csv**

This file contains the data I used to perform the analysis. The listings file is for Airbnb, Seattle. The original source of the file is Kaggle.

## 4. How to interact with the project

The necessary steps for the entire data analysis pipeline is described in a step-wise manner in the Jupyter notebook. The data can be downloaded from here. Following data download the notebook cells can be re-run without changes or modifications can be made that attempt to improve upon the existing analysis. A summary of major insight gained from the analysis includes:

* a) Neighborhood groups play an important role in price determination. However, in combination with other features of listing the price can set to gain suitable profit margins. 
* b) The amenities provided and flexibility to accommodate guests can be distinguish features that guide customer flow.
* c) Writing creative and resonant descriptions of listings with proper portrayal of key features can be helpful to remain competitive
